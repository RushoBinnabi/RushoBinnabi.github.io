    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350&deg;F (176&deg;C).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Lightly grease and flour your preferred size bread pan.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            If using dry yeast, put the yeast into a cup filled with 3/4 of the way
            with <br> either water or milk with a pinch of sugar and leave covered on
            the side for 10-15 <br> minutes and allow to bloom. After it has bloomed or
            if using instant yeast, combine <br> yeast, flour, salt, eggs, and milk or
            water in a large bowl until the dough starts to come together.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes or until
            the dough <br> starts to form a smooth ball. Adjust with more milk or water as needed.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Put the kneaded dough into a bowl, making sure to brush the dough and the bowl
            with 1-2 tbsp <br> of oil, cover, and leave to proof for an hour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Transfer to a clean surface and start forming the dough into a log, making
            sure to close any gaps <br> in the dough and transfer into the prepared bread pan.
            Cover and leave to proof for another hour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Brush with egg wash if desired and transfer to oven and bake for 30 minutes until the bread sounds <br> hollow in the middle.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Brush with butter if desired and leave to cool for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving.
