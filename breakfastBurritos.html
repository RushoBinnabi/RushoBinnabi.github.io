    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the tortillas or flatbread until golden brown. Lay onto a sheet pan to cool.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large pan, sauté the ground beef with some oil and 1/4 of the seasonings.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove the beef from the pan and put it to a bowl. Then dice the tomato, onion, <br> and potato and
            put them into a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook the potatoes with 1/4 of the seasonings until cooked through and soft.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add back the diced onion and tomato with the potatoes and sauté for 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add back the ground beef into the pan and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Create a well in the middle of the pan. Beat the eggs with some salt and pepper <br>
            and pour it into the pan and using a spatula, making sure to draw the eggs towards <br>
            the center, scrambling them with the rest of the seasonings. Cool completely.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Take some of the filling and put them onto the tortillas or flat bread, making <br>
            sure to not overfill. Gently fold them and tuck in the sides and place them <br>
            back onto the sheet pan as you go.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Put them into the freezer for 1 hour to set.</li>
        <br>
        <li>After 1 hour, transfer them into bags and store them in the freezer.</li>
    </ol>
