                1 bowl of Nissin Hot & Spicy Ramen</a>
                <br>
        <br><li>1/4 tsp of Salt, adjust as needed</li>
        <br><li>1/4 tsp of Pepper, adjust as needed</li>
        <br><li>1/4 tsp of Cumin Powder, adjust as needed</li>
        <br><li>1/4 tsp of Paprika, adjust as needed</li>
        <br><li>1/4 tsp of Garlic Powder, adjust as needed</li>
        <br><li>1/2 cup of bread crumbs</li>
        <br><li>1/4 lemon</li>
        <br><li>Oil, as needed</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <br><h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, place the pack of Ramen along with its flavor packets.</li>
        <br><li>Saut√© together the diced onion, tomato, and sliced mushrooms along <br> with some oil and half of the seasonings
                until the tomatoes and onions are soft <br> and changed color, and the mushrooms are cooked through.
                Put them into <br> the bowl with the Ramen and set aside.</li>
        <br><li>Beat one of the eggs with some milk and combine the bread crumbs with <br> the rest of the seasoning and the juice from the lemon.</li>
        <br><li>Dip the chicken into the egg mixture until the chicken is well coated. Transfer to <br> bread crumbs and coat well.</li>
        <br><li>Fry until the chicken reaches 165&deg;F (74&deg;C). While the chicken cooks, fill the bowl <br> of Ramen with some boiling water until the Ramen is just about submerged and <br> leave covered.</li>
        <br><li>After the chicken is cooked, rest for 10 minutes. After it has cooled, cut against the grain.</li>
        <br><li>Take the remaining egg mixture and quickly scramble in low heat with the leftover bread crumbs.</li>
        <br><li>Place the chicken and the scrambled eggs into the Ramen, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
